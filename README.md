# 3dobject
This is how the raw version would look like, we can edit it further by adding more functionalities, but for now this is the simple version I created.
We can use the change color button with simple HTML to change the color of ball with random colors, that I made using the random function.
It also has the rotatable feature, the next step was to add texture as well, but for now I've kept it as the simple version.
